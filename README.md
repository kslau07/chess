Odin Ruby Project: Chess
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project

Odin's final project for Ruby is to build a chess game. It will be played in the console. It must have the ability to save and load games. We will utilize RSpec again for testing purposes.

Description from webpage:

Assignment
Build a command line Chess game where two players can play against each other.

The game should be properly constrained – it should prevent players from making illegal moves and declare check or check mate in the correct situations.

Make it so you can save the board at any time (remember how to serialize?)

Write tests for the important parts. You don’t need to TDD it (unless you want to), but be sure to use RSpec tests for anything that you find yourself typing into the command line repeatedly.

Do your best to keep your classes modular and clean and your methods doing only one thing each. This is the largest program that you’ve written, so you’ll definitely start to see the benefits of good organization (and testing) when you start running into bugs.

Unfamiliar with Chess? Check out some of the additional resources to help you get your bearings.

Have fun! Check out the unicode characters for a little spice for your gameboard.

(Optional extension) Build a very simple AI computer player (perhaps who does a random legal move)
